Thanks for wanting to contribute to MyAnimeList — your suggestions and PRs are welcome!

Quick summary
- You can suggest a new anime or suggest README improvements by opening an Issue (use the templates) or by submitting a Pull Request.
- By contributing you agree to license your contribution under the repository MIT license.

How to suggest an anime (recommended)
1. Open a new Issue using the "Recommendation" template and fill the fields (title, AniList/MAL link, type, score, year, genres, short note).
2. If you prefer to submit a PR, fork the repo → create a branch → edit the README (or data file if one exists) → open a PR.

How to make a Pull Request
1. Fork the repo and create a feature branch: git checkout -b add-anime-<title>
2. Make your change (preferably edit only relevant sections)
3. Preview your Markdown locally (VS Code, GitHub desktop or other Markdown preview)
4. Commit with a clear message and push the branch to your fork
5. Open a PR against main and link the Issue (if one exists)

Contribution rules & formatting
- Follow the existing README style: Title (linked to AniList/MAL) — Type, ⭐ score, | Genres
- Use Anilist or MyAnimeList links where possible.
- Keep entries consistent (Title — TV/Movie/OVA — ⭐ x.x | genres).
- One anime per PR helps reviews go faster.
- If adding multiple entries, list them alphabetically within the same letter section.

Issues & PR triage
- Use the provided issue templates (Recommendation / Suggestion) so maintainers can triage quickly.
- Add any helpful context (why you recommend, source links, screenshots if requesting formatting changes).

Code of conduct & license
- Be respectful and constructive. If you plan to contribute code in the future, follow standard GitHub etiquette.
- All contributions are licensed under the project's MIT license.

Need help?
- Mention @Shineii86 in the issue or message via the contact links in the README if you need a hand.
- If you want, I can open a PR with these templates for you — tell me to proceed.
